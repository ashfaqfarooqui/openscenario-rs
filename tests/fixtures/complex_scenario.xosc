<!-- Complex OpenSCENARIO test file for comprehensive functionality validation

  This file contains:
  - Advanced OpenSCENARIO features (distributions, catalogs, complex actions)
  - Multiple entities with complex interactions and dependencies
  - Advanced geometry (clothoids, NURBS curves) and trajectory following
  - Complex trigger conditions and multi-level story structure
  - Environmental conditions and dynamic parameter changes
  
  Contributes to project by:
  - Testing advanced library features and edge cases
  - Validating performance with realistic scenario complexity
  - Ensuring comprehensive feature coverage in testing
  - Supporting stress testing and performance validation
  - Providing realistic use case validation for complex scenarios -->
