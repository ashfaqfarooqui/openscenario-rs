<!-- Simple OpenSCENARIO test file for basic parsing validation
  
  This file contains:
  - Minimal valid OpenSCENARIO structure with required elements
  - Basic entity definitions and simple maneuvers
  - Standard parameter usage patterns
  - Common trigger conditions and actions
  - Representative but simple scenario content
  
  Contributes to project by:
  - Providing baseline test case for parser validation
  - Ensuring basic functionality works correctly
  - Serving as reference for minimal valid scenario structure
  - Supporting rapid test execution with lightweight content
  - Enabling focused testing of core functionality without complexity -->

<!-- Actual OpenSCENARIO XML content will be added during implementation -->
