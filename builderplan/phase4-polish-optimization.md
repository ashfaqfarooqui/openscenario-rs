After Phase 4 completion, the library should support advanced patterns like:

```rust
// Macro-based scenario construction
let scenario = scenario! {
    header: {
        title: "Highway Merge Test",
        author: "Test Engineer",
        date: "2024-01-15T10:00:00",
    },
    
    parameters: {
        initial_speed: Double = "25.0",
        target_speed: Double = "35.0",
    },
    
    entities: {
        ego: vehicle!("TestCar") {
            position: lane!("highway", 1, 100.0),
            speed: parameter!("initial_speed"),
        },
        
        target: vehicle!("TestCar") {
            position: lane!("highway", 1, 200.0),
            speed: "30.0",
        },
    },
    
    story: "main" {
        act: "acceleration" {
            maneuver: "speed_up" {
                event: "accelerate" {
                    action: longitudinal!(ego).speed(parameter!("target_speed")),
                    trigger: condition!(simulation_time > 2.0),
                },
            },
        },
    },
};

// Template-based construction
let template = ScenarioTemplate::load("highway_merge.yaml")?;
let scenario = template
    .with_parameter("initial_speed", 30.0)
    .with_parameter("target_speed", 40.0)
    .build()?;

// Advanced validation and analysis
let report = scenario
    .validate()
    .with_strict_mode()
    .with_custom_rules(&custom_rules)
    .generate_report()?;
```

## Integration Testing

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod phase4_integration_tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_performance_optimization() {
        let start = Instant::now();
        
        let scenario = ScenarioBuilder::new()
            .with_simple_header("Performance Test", "Benchmark")
            .with_default_catalogs()
            .with_road_network("test.xodr")
            .with_entities();
            
        // Add 1000 entities efficiently
        let mut builder = scenario;
        for i in 0..1000 {
            builder = builder.add_vehicle(&format!("vehicle_{}", i))
                .car()
                .at_position().world(i as f64 * 5.0, 0.0, 0.0)
                .finish_vehicle();
        }
        
        let scenario = builder.build().expect("Should build large scenario");
        let duration = start.elapsed();
        
        // Performance requirements
        assert!(duration < Duration::from_secs(5), "Build time too slow: {:?}", duration);
        assert_eq!(scenario.entities.unwrap().scenario_objects.len(), 1000);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_macro_integration() {
        let scenario = scenario! {
            header: { title: "Macro Test", author: "Developer" },
            entities: {
                test_car: vehicle!("TestModel") {
                    position: world!(0.0, 0.0, 0.0),
                },
            },
        };
        
        assert!(scenario.is_ok());
    }
}
```

## Notes for Implementers

1. **Performance Focus**: This phase should significantly improve performance without compromising correctness
2. **User Experience**: Every interaction should feel polished and professional
3. **Production Ready**: The library should be ready for production use after this phase
4. **Community**: Consider community feedback and ecosystem needs
5. **Documentation**: Documentation quality should match or exceed the code quality

## Final Deliverable

After Phase 4, the OpenSCENARIO-rs builder system should be:
- **Complete**: Supporting all major OpenSCENARIO features
- **Performant**: Suitable for production workloads
- **Polished**: Providing excellent developer experience
- **Documented**: With comprehensive guides and examples
- **Tested**: With high-quality test coverage
- **Ready**: For 1.0 release and community adoption

This represents a production-ready, type-safe, ergonomic builder pattern implementation for the OpenSCENARIO-rs library that enables programmatic scenario construction with compile-time safety and runtime performance.
