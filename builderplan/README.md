# OpenSCENARIO-rs Builder Implementation Plan

## Overview

This directory contains the phased implementation plan for adding a builder pattern to the OpenSCENARIO-rs library. The builder pattern enables ergonomic, type-safe programmatic construction of OpenSCENARIO documents.

## Implementation Status

- [x] **Phase 0**: Foundation Analysis and Planning
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Core Infrastructure (Type States, Errors, Registry, Core Builder)
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Document Type Support (Catalog and Parameter Variation builders)
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Advanced Features (Complete action/condition builders)
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Polish & Optimization (Fluent APIs and performance)

## File Structure

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Coding Agents

Each phase file contains:
- **Context**: Background and dependencies
- **Implementation Tasks**: Specific coding tasks with file paths
- **Code Examples**: Complete, working code snippets
- **Checklist**: Progress tracking for each component
- **Success Criteria**: How to verify completion
- **Testing Requirements**: Tests that must pass

### Development Approach

1. **Sequential Implementation**: Complete phases in order (dependencies flow forward)
2. **Parallel Development**: Within each phase, tasks can be done in parallel
3. **Validation**: Each phase has verification steps before proceeding
4. **Integration**: Regular integration testing between components

### Project Context

**Codebase**: OpenSCENARIO-rs library with 347+ XSD types implemented
**Goal**: Type-safe builder pattern for programmatic scenario construction
**Architecture**: Type state pattern with compile-time safety
**Integration**: Seamless integration with existing validation and catalog systems

## Quick Start for Implementers

1. Read `phase0-foundation.md` for project context
2. Start with `phase1-core-infrastructure.md` 
3. Implement each file listed in the phase checklist
4. Verify completion using success criteria
5. Move to next phase

## Key Design Principles

- **Type Safety**: Compile-time prevention of invalid scenarios
- **Ergonomic APIs**: Fluent interfaces that read like natural language  
- **Progressive Construction**: Step-by-step building with clear guidance
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Support for all document types and XSD features
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing type system

## Support

For questions or issues during implementation:
- Refer to the existing codebase in `src/types/`
- Check the original `builder_plan.md` for detailed specifications
- All code examples are verified to compile with the actual type system
