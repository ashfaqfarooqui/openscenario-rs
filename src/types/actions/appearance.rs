//! Appearance and animation action types for visual representation
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Light state actions for vehicle lighting systems
//! - Animation actions for entity movement and component animation
//! - Pedestrian gesture and motion animations
//! - Vehicle component animations (doors, windows, etc.)
//! - Custom user-defined animation support
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Enabling realistic visual representation of scenario entities
//! - Supporting complex animation sequences for pedestrians and vehicles
//! - Providing lighting control for realistic day/night scenarios
//! - Enabling custom animations through extensible user-defined types
//! - Facilitating visual simulation output and rendering integration
