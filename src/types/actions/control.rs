//! Controller and control override action types
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Controller assignment and activation actions
//! - Override actions for manual control (throttle, brake, steering, gear)
//! - Controller configuration and parameter setting
//! - Control system integration and handoff logic
//! - Multi-controller coordination and conflict resolution
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Enabling realistic vehicle control through AI controllers and manual overrides
//! - Supporting simulation of different driver behaviors and capabilities
//! - Providing fine-grained control over vehicle dynamics and responses
//! - Facilitating testing of control systems and human-machine interfaces
//! - Enabling smooth transitions between automated and manual control modes
