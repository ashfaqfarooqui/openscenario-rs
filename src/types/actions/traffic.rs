//! Traffic generation and management action types
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Traffic source and sink actions for dynamic traffic generation
//! - Traffic swarm actions for crowd simulation around entities
//! - Traffic area actions for regional traffic density control
//! - Traffic signal control actions for intersection management
//! - Background traffic definition and distribution specifications
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Enabling realistic traffic environments for scenario testing
//! - Providing dynamic traffic generation and removal capabilities
//! - Supporting complex traffic patterns and density variations
//! - Facilitating intersection and traffic signal simulation
//! - Enabling large-scale traffic simulation with efficient distribution models
