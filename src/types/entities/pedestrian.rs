//! Pedestrian entity types and pedestrian-specific behaviors
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Pedestrian definition with category and physical properties
//! - Pedestrian motion types (walking, running, cycling, etc.)
//! - Pedestrian gesture definitions for realistic animations
//! - Pedestrian role assignments and behavior patterns
//! - Animal and wheelchair accessibility support
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Enabling realistic pedestrian simulation in urban scenarios
//! - Supporting diverse pedestrian behaviors and motion patterns
//! - Providing rich animation possibilities through gestures and motions
//! - Facilitating accessibility testing through wheelchair support
//! - Enabling complex pedestrian-vehicle interaction scenarios
