//! Entity-based condition types for scenario triggering
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Spatial conditions (distance, collision, position-based triggers)
//! - Motion conditions (speed, acceleration, standstill detection)
//! - State conditions (end-of-road, off-road, clearance checks)
//! - Temporal conditions (time headway, time-to-collision)
//! - Relative conditions comparing entities to each other
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Enabling realistic scenario triggering based on entity behavior
//! - Providing comprehensive spatial relationship monitoring
//! - Supporting safety-critical condition detection (collision, clearance)
//! - Facilitating dynamic scenario adaptation based on entity states
//! - Enabling complex multi-entity coordination and interaction patterns
