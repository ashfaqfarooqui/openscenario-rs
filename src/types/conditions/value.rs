//! Value-based condition types for parameter and time-based triggering
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Parameter conditions for scenario parameter monitoring
//! - Variable conditions for dynamic variable state checking
//! - Time-based conditions (simulation time, time-of-day)
//! - Storyboard element state conditions for execution flow control
//! - Traffic signal conditions for infrastructure interaction
//! - User-defined custom condition support
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Enabling scenario control through parameter and variable monitoring
//! - Supporting time-based scenario progression and scheduling
//! - Providing execution flow control through storyboard state tracking
//! - Facilitating infrastructure integration through signal state monitoring
//! - Enabling custom condition logic through extensible user-defined types
