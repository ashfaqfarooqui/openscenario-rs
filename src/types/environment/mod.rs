//! Environment type module for weather, lighting, and road conditions
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Base environment traits and common environmental behaviors
//! - Environment validation and consistency checking
//! - Environmental parameter management and interpolation
//! - Cross-cutting environmental concerns (time progression, weather changes)
//! - Integration with rendering and physics systems
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Organizing 12+ environment types into logical categories
//! - Providing consistent framework for environmental simulation
//! - Supporting dynamic environmental changes during scenarios
//! - Enabling realistic environmental conditions for testing
//! - Facilitating integration with weather and lighting systems
