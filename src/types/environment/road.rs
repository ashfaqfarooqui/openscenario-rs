//! Road condition and infrastructure types
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - RoadCondition with friction and wetness parameters
//! - RoadNetwork integration with logic and scene graph files
//! - Traffic signal infrastructure and controller definitions
//! - Road surface properties and grip conditions
//! - UsedArea definitions for scenario spatial bounds
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Supporting realistic road surface simulation and vehicle dynamics
//! - Enabling integration with road network databases (OpenDRIVE)
//! - Providing traffic signal infrastructure for intersection scenarios
//! - Supporting variable road conditions for weather-dependent testing
//! - Facilitating scenario spatial bounds and area restrictions
