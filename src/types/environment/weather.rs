//! Weather condition types for environmental simulation
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Weather definition with atmospheric conditions and precipitation
//! - Sun positioning and lighting conditions with time progression
//! - Fog conditions with visibility parameters and spatial bounds
//! - Precipitation types (rain, snow) with intensity specifications
//! - Wind conditions with direction and speed parameters
//! - Dome image support for realistic sky rendering
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Enabling realistic weather simulation for scenario testing
//! - Supporting dynamic lighting conditions and day/night cycles
//! - Providing atmospheric conditions that affect visibility and handling
//! - Facilitating weather-dependent scenario validation
//! - Supporting integration with weather simulation and rendering systems
