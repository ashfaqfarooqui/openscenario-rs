//! Basic geometric shapes for area and boundary definitions
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Polyline for connected line segment paths
//! - Polygon for closed area definitions and boundaries
//! - Vertex definitions with position and timing information
//! - BoundingBox for object spatial extents and collision detection
//! - Geometric validation and self-intersection checking
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Providing fundamental geometric primitives for scenario definition
//! - Supporting area-based operations (traffic zones, restricted areas)
//! - Enabling collision detection and spatial queries
//! - Facilitating path definition and route planning
//! - Supporting geometric validation and consistency checking
