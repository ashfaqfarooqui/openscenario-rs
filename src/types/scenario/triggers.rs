//! Trigger and event types for scenario timing and control
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Event definitions with actions and trigger conditions
//! - Trigger combinations and condition group logic
//! - Condition evaluation and edge detection logic
//! - TriggeringEntities for entity-based condition evaluation
//! - Event priority and execution order management
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Enabling event-driven scenario execution and timing control
//! - Supporting complex trigger logic through condition combinations
//! - Providing precise event timing through edge detection
//! - Facilitating entity-aware trigger conditions and responses
//! - Supporting deterministic event ordering and priority handling
