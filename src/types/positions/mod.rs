//! Position type module for all spatial positioning systems
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Base position traits and common positioning behaviors
//! - Position conversion utilities between coordinate systems
//! - Orientation handling and coordinate system transformations
//! - Position validation and constraint checking
//! - Spatial relationship calculations and utilities
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Organizing 15+ position types into logical coordinate system categories
//! - Providing consistent interface for all positioning methods
//! - Enabling seamless conversion between different coordinate systems
//! - Supporting both absolute and relative positioning strategies
//! - Facilitating spatial calculations and geometric operations
