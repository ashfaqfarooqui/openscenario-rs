//! Scenario builder for programmatic scenario construction
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - ScenarioBuilder with fluent API for scenario construction
//! - Type-safe builder methods preventing invalid scenario states
//! - Builder validation at construction time rather than runtime
//! - Integration with catalog system for component reuse
//! - Builder serialization for saving constructed scenarios
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Enabling programmatic scenario generation and testing
//! - Providing type safety during scenario construction
//! - Supporting automated scenario generation from templates
//! - Facilitating scenario testing and validation workflows
//! - Enabling integration with scenario generation tools and frameworks

/// # Scenario Builder Pattern Specification
/// 
/// This module will implement a fluent builder pattern for programmatic scenario construction.
/// 
/// ## Core Builder Structure (Week 7)
/// ```rust,ignore
/// pub struct ScenarioBuilder {
///     scenario: OpenScenario,
///     validation_ctx: ValidationContext,
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Basic Builder Methods
/// ```rust,ignore
/// impl ScenarioBuilder {
///     /// Create empty scenario with sensible defaults
///     pub fn new() -> Self;
///     
///     /// Set file header information
///     pub fn file_header(mut self, header: FileHeader) -> Self;
///     
///     /// Finalize and validate the constructed scenario
///     pub fn build(self) -> Result<OpenScenario>;
/// }
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Entity Building Methods
/// ```rust,ignore
/// /// Add a vehicle entity to the scenario
/// pub fn add_vehicle(mut self, name: &str, vehicle: Vehicle) -> Self;
/// 
/// /// Add a pedestrian entity to the scenario
/// pub fn add_pedestrian(mut self, name: &str, pedestrian: Pedestrian) -> Self;
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Story Building Methods (Later Phases)
/// ```rust,ignore
/// /// Add a story to the scenario storyboard
/// pub fn add_story(mut self, story: Story) -> Self;
/// 
/// /// Add an initialization action
/// pub fn add_init_action(mut self, action: Action) -> Self;
/// ```
/// 
/// ## Validation Strategy
/// - Validate entity name uniqueness during construction
/// - Check required fields and dependencies
/// - Return descriptive errors for invalid builder state
/// - Perform final validation in `build()` method
/// 
/// ## Convenience Methods
/// ```rust,ignore
/// /// Add ego vehicle with standard configuration
/// pub fn with_ego_vehicle(mut self, vehicle: Vehicle) -> Self;
/// 
/// /// Set up basic scenario structure with common defaults
/// pub fn with_simple_scenario_structure(mut self) -> Self;
/// ```
