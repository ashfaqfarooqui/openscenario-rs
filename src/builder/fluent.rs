//! Fluent API implementation for ergonomic scenario building
//!
//! This file contains:
//! - Fluent method chaining for natural scenario construction syntax
//! - Builder macros for reducing boilerplate in common patterns
//! - Method overloading simulation through trait implementations
//! - Builder state transitions ensuring valid construction sequences
//! - Integration with IDE tooling for autocomplete and type hints
//!
//! Contributes to project by:
//! - Providing ergonomic, readable scenario construction APIs
//! - Reducing boilerplate and improving developer experience
//! - Supporting natural language-like scenario building patterns
//! - Enabling rapid prototyping and iterative scenario development
//! - Facilitating adoption through intuitive API design
